# Project  MovieMela
Create a single web page application using HTML, CSS-, JS and Vue JS doing the following
1) Display a list of movies. Things to be displayed: Poster image of the movie, Name. Make an ajax call to the following URL to get the data to be displayed:
http://www.omdbapi.com/
you have to send the following data along with it:
s= harry potter
apikey= e0620bd4

2)You can use axios library to make an ajax call or use jquery ajax call. 2) When clicked on the movie, show the summary of the movie.
3) Give a form to add a new movie on the same page (either a pop up or at the end of the page). When a user adds in the information for the movie, show a live preview of
his inputs. This newly added movie then should be visible in the list of movies. (For taking an image from the user, user can add a URL from google images or something
instead of from their computer)
